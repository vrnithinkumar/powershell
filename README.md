Powershell scripts to automate boring tasks

## 1) StandUpScript.ps1

  Powershell script that will alert at each hour by Desktop notification as well as using beep sound. To avoid continues sitting and working this script will help to remind to stand up or relax each hour. It will lock the PC at each hour too :)

## 1) DeleteBitchingDLLs.ps1
  Its too annoying to see the {Visual Studio “Could not copy” … during build} error. Solution is to delete that all the bitching dll's. Its too shitty process. So this script will delete all the dll in the error message.
### Using :
    Copy the error messages in the VS and copy in to the text box from the script rest it will take care.
